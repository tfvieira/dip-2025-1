# Salt & Pepper Noise Removal

This exercise is part of the Digital Image Processing course. Your task is to implement a function to remove **salt and pepper noise** from a grayscale image using Python and OpenCV.

## Files

- `student_template.py`: The file you will complete and submit.
- `head.png`: The input image with salt and pepper noise.
- `head_filtered.png`: The expected output after applying noise removal.

## Objective

Implement a function `remove_salt_and_pepper_noise(image)` that removes noise using appropriate filters while preserving as much detail as possible.

## Submission

Submit only the `student_template.py` file after implementing your solution.
